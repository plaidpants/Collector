# Collector

This is a data collection, analysis and charting application that was created by me while working as a research assistant at the University of Minnesota for the Cosmic Ray Research group headed by Phylis Fryer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_S._Freier) and Jake Waddington. It allowed for real-time collection of data from cosmic ray detection devices.
